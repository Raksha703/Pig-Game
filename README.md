# Pig Game

The Pig Game is a simple dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score (default is 100).

## Game Rules

- The game has two players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want. Each roll gets added to their current score.
- However, if a player rolls a 1, all their current score is lost, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to "Hold," which means that their current score gets added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach the specified winning score (default is 100) wins the game.
